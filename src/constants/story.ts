export const storyText = `It was the year 1955. The ACME laboratory in Utah was a facility that was shrouded by much mystery and secrecy. No one was certain of the manner of unspeakable things that transpired behind the four walls of the facility. But it had been long rumored that the scientists were running unsanctioned and somewhat unorthodox experiments, in hopes of finally uncovering the truth of whether we are truly alone in the universe. The discovery would have been welcomed, but many feared they would inadvertently open a gateway to unforeseen horrors and inconceivable nightmares. So they deemed it best that the scientists stayed their hands from matters beyond their comprehension.
But unlike the townspeople who only saw risks and unfathomable consequences, the scientists and engineers of the ACME lab saw hope and a once-in-a-lifetime kind of opportunity. Within the top secret restricted grounds of the facility, they were building the prototype of a machine that would hold the propensity of tearing a gap through the fabric of space and time; a PORTAL MACHINE. In theory, the machine was designed to generate enough quantum power to create a wormhole that could connect to different realms and possibly alternate dimensions across the universe. They were well aware of the risks involved. They knew there was a possibility that whoever or whatever they might find on the other side of the warm hole might not entirely come in peace. They knew they could invariably open the door to unknown creatures that could bring about the annihilation and extinction of the earth, but they were still optimistic. The reward of finally dousing the flames of their curiosity far outweighed the risks or consequences that could ensue. They had spent years and insane amounts of money building the portal machine, and it seemed like it was finally ready. The stage was set, the cameras were rolling, and they were all itching to make history. All the scientists and engineers stood behind a glass door, anxiously peering into the room.
With one push of a button, the machine was ACTIVATED. Everything was progressing as expected. Multiple beams of light flashed from the machine, after which a whirlwind began to brew. A thunderous sound erupted from the void within the circumference of the machine. They all stood in amazement as a colorful wormhole slowly began to rip open right before their eyes. The atmosphere was tense but also ecstatic. The wormhole expanded to the full width of the machine. And to their utter awe and amazement, they found themselves staring into what looked like an alternate universe. It looked nothing like earth, but most interestingly, there was a shiny toaster-like being standing in front of the wormhole. He looked confused and disoriented at the same time. He hesitantly stepped through the portal. The scientists were euphoric- IT WORKED! Or so they thought…
Suddenly, a red warning light began to beep from the machine- something was wrong! There was widespread panic. The power stabilizer within the machine had malfunctioned, and as a result, the power began to surge uncontrollably. The portal machine went on overdrive. It randomly began to open portals into different worlds and alternate realities. The same being they saw from the first wormhole kept popping through each of the open portals. Everything was happening so quickly. What began with just one, soon multiplied to a hundred, and then to thousands. Before they could kill the power to the machine, the room was already flooded with approximately 10,000 versions
of the strange Toaster. They all kept repeating one-word “POLLY.” Ordinarily, that was the name the scientists branded them.
The scientist at the ACME lab knew they couldn’t accommodate all the POLLY(s), so they began offering them out to the highest bidder. They hoped to clear out their Lab as quickly as possible, so they could recommence their exploration of the universe.`
